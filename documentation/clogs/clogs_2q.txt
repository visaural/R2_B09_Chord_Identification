    - Installation of Programming Tools
        > Try using first workstation
            - on Windows
            - on dual boot Linux

    - NN design
        - What's the input of the NN?
        - Try a 12x37 design
        - Try NN with subset of chords
        - Use laptop as smaller-subset try of study

    - Statistical techniques
        - What methods should be used?
        - Datasets are identical, is this valid?

    - Connections
        - Ma'am Marian and her friends
        - NCAC

Solving the "Don't install in default location" ambiguity problem
    - install Anaconda in another location in C:
    

Easy localization of project
    - Go over methodology again so that this is ensured
    
Understanding NNs
    - Last session we talked about connections
    - Ma'am Marian: learn NN during break
    - NCAC: maybe during Christmas break?
    - Kiel: Try preliminary studies
    - Determination of Sample size per pass
        > No idea
        > Might be dependent on the design
        > Use the break and connections

Design of NN
    - Don't follow the MADALINE model
    - Try finding more efficient ways to design the NN

Both of us have perios
    - Physics (11/13)
    
Next meeting: Next-next week
Task: Follow up LJ
